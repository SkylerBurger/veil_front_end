NOTE ON THE COLOR TAROT CARD IMAGES: Holly Voley has graciously scanned a set of vintage Tarot cards for sacred-texts, the earliest in her collection. These images can be viewed when you click on any of the black and white thumbnails in the Pictorial Key to the Tarot, or in the right-hand frame in the Tarot card reader. They can also be viewed sequentially in the Tarot Card Cross-reference. These Tarot card images are unambiguously in the public domain in the United States, and differ only slightly from the US Games Tarot deck. This deck is the one known as the 'Pamela-A' deck with the dried mud pattern on the back of the cards. There are also high resolution images of three of the Pamela-A cards available below in the Tarot Card Comparison essay.
